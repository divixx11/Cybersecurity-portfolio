# Cybersecurity-portfolio
Hi! Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio. I developed this portfolio to demonstrate my hands-on skills in threat analysis, network security, ethical hacking, and other working projects and labs in cybersecurity.

About Me

I am currently a candidate for the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and a 3rd-semester college student interested in cybersecurity. I am fascinated with security because, aside from the theory, I have a passion for learning and applying hands-on skills.

My main skills are:
Network Security
Linux Systems & File Permissions
Security Automation using Python, Bash, and SQL
Vulnerability Scanning & Penetration Testing
Analytical & Logical Problem Solving
Portfolio Contents
